    <p> This section will be explaining on a famous word search game called "Hangman". The game will be recreated in Python programming. </p>
    <p> The game is a good beginner practice for coders to code in Python. </p>
    <p> The game will involve strings, loops and conditional statements (if, else, elif).</p>

    <p>The source code is taken from <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-program-for-word-guessing-game/">an outside source</a> so I do not own any of this. Haha xD</p>

    <p>In this game, the program will use the random function to choose one word for the current session.</p>
    <p>First things first, name is required before we start.</p>
    <p>Then, the player would have to guess the word based on given clue. The clue would be total number of alphabet in the word.</p>
    <p>How many "-" will be visible based on the total alphabet. </p>
    <p>If the player guess the right alphabet, it will be shown as the output (with correct placement) else the program will ask you to guess another alphabet.</p>
    <p>The number of turns can be decided depending on the word's guessing difficulty. </p>

    <p>Quick recap on what happened so far:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>We covered a word guessing game called "Hangman" using Python.</li>
      <li>The gameplay is simple. User key in his/her name, then start guessing the word from the hints on the screen. When they reach the maximum guess, it will be game over. If the user can guess it right, then it is a win for them.</li>
      <li>This game is quite simple, using random library, condition statements and a simple python statements.</li>
      <li>You can add more </li>
      <li>That's it, simple right?</li>
    </ul>
